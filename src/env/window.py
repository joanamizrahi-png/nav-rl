"""Fusion window: which recorded frames' Gaussians a query may use.

The reconstructor makes one Gaussian per pixel per frame. In static mode they
are all fused into one constant set (timestamp -1), in dynamic mode each frame
keeps its own group (timestamp = frame index). Coverage computed over the
fully fused set saturates -- almost every pixel is backed by *something* seen
from *somewhere* -- so it cannot tell a view the nearby frames observed from a
view they never looked at. Restricting to the w frames nearest the query
(by the same nearest-position rule that picks the query time) gives a
coverage that falls both when the robot leaves the path and when it turns
away from where those frames looked.

Two knobs, both in CalibratedBackendConfig:
  render_window   > 0: rasterize RGB / depth / labels from the window only
                       (the "static-21" middle ground between static and dynamic)
  coverage_window > 0: compute the coverage statistic from the window only,
                       one extra opacity-only rasterization per step; the
                       image itself may still come from the full fusion

Requires the `source_frame` tag on constant Gaussian sets (NeoVerse
rasterization.py, _create_constant_gaussians). Dynamic per-frame groups are
selected by their own timestamp and need no tag.
